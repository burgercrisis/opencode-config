## What I do

- Analyze all staged and unstaged changes in the working directory
- Group related changes into logical, atomic commits
- Create meaningful commit messages that describe each change set
- Push all commits to the current remote branch

## When to use me

Use this when you have multiple unrelated changes staged or unstaged and want to organize them into clean, focused commits before pushing. This skill is ideal for:
- Cleaning up a messy working directory before pushing
- Splitting large changes into logical pieces
- Ensuring each commit tells a coherent story

## How I work

1. First, I show you the proposed commit structure and get confirmation
2. For each commit, I explain what changes will be included
3. I use meaningful commit messages following conventional commit format
4. After you approve, I create the commits and push them

## Requirements

- All changes must be committed to the current branch
- Remote must be configured and accessible
- You must have push permissions to the branch

Ask clarifying questions if:
- The grouping of changes is unclear
- You prefer a specific commit message format
- You want to exclude certain files from commits
